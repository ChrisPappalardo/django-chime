Quickstart
----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the package from github using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/ChrisPappalardo/django-chime.git

Or you can include it in your requirements file like so:

.. code-block:: none

   git+https://github.com/ChrisPappalardo/django-chime.git@master#egg=django-chime

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to add the :literal:`django_chime` application to the
:literal:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting of your project's :literal:`settings.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = (

       ...

       'django_chime',
   )

This will make the models, views, and templates available in your project.

You will also need to migrate your database to use the django-chime models:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python manage.py migrate

Views
~~~~~

To allow users to access the django-chime views, you will need to add a path
declaration to :literal:`urlpatterns` in your project :literal:`urls.py` like so:

.. code-block:: python

   from django_chime.views import ChimeSiteView

   ...

   urlpatterns = [

       ...

       # django-chime deployed models view (authentication optional)
       path(
           '<uuid:pk>/',
           ChimeSiteView.as_view(),
           name='site',
       ),

       # django-chime model management view (requires authentication)
       path(
           'chime/',
           include("django_chime.urls"),
       ),

       ...

Once logged in, users can navigate to :literal:`/chime/` to create and configure their
CHIME models.  Once created, the CHIME models are visible without authentication
at :literal:`/<ID of CHIME model>/`.

To use the templates that come with django-chime, you will need to add the following
blocks to your project base template :literal:`base.html`:

.. code-block:: jinja

   ...

   {% block external_css %}
   {% endblock external_css %}

   ...

   {% block headline %}
   {% endblock headline %}

   ...

   {% block section_content %}
   {% endblock section_content %}

   ...

   {% block external_javascript %}
   {% endblock external_javascript %}

   {% block project_javascript %}
   {% endblock project_javascript %}

.. note::

   You will need to add the css blocks to the :literal:`<head>` section and the
   javascript blocks to the *bottom* of the :literal:`<body>` section of your
   base template.

As an alternative, try using the base template from
`djcorecap <https://github.com/ChrisPappalardo/djcorecap>`_, as the base for
your project, it's awesome!
