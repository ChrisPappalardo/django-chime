Quickstart
----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the package from github using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/ChrisPappalardo/django-chime.git

Or you can include it in your requirements file like so:

.. code-block:: none

   git+https://github.com/ChrisPappalardo/django-chime.git

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to add the `django_chime` application to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting of
your project's `settings.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       ...
       'django_chime',
   )

This will make the models, views, and templates available in your project.

Views
~~~~~

To allow users to access the `django_chime` views, you will need to add a path
declaration to `urlpatterns` in your project `urls.py` like so:

.. code-block:: python

   from django_chime.views import ChimeSiteView

   ...

   path(
       "<uuid:pk>/",
       ChimeSiteView.as_view(),
       name='site',
   ),

   path(
       "chime/",
       include("django_chime.urls"),
   ),

Once logged in, users can navigate to `/chime/` to create and configure their
CHIME models.  Once created, the CHIME models are visible without authentication
at `/<ID of CHIME model>/`.
